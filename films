Oh, I'm a human, and my breathing tube is next to my eating tube. Oh, and look, my arms end in stupid little sticks.
This guy says 'hello', I wanna kill myself.
You left me and I fell apart. I punched the wall and cried. Bam! Bam! Bam!
Is it weird having sex with someone who looks just like you, or is that kind of the point?
You had me at 'hello'.
Well, nobody's perfect.
Stay strong, stay silent and more than anything else, trust no one.
What about your children? Who knows if they're even mine? Trust me, those inbreds are definitely yours.
I'd rather have a half-life with you than a full life with anyone else.
Someone once taught me that, to find yourself, to find your truth, you need to get lost a bit first.

Oh my God. All this time I've been hating her, have I actually been in love with her?
I'm in a relationship with myself, and I am a lot of work.
I just want you to be happy even if it's without me.
How many days do we really remember anyway? Most days pass by unnoticed, unremarkable, unmarked.
We only remember the days we feel something happened. Something beautiful or tragic.
Step up when it's time to step up.
Mistakes I can handle, but regrets I can't live with.
I love the way your brain works.
I didn't know how much I could actually love until I met you and it keeps growing every single day.
You make me feel like I can do anything. We can do anything and I wanna do it all.
Now or never.
We could be at Chuck E. Cheese and I would still be smiling.
No early goodbyes.
Because of you, I have found someone in me that I never would have known, someone that I never would have become. You found me.
Every morning I wake up and I choose you. I choose us, I choose this.
If you're not happy, change.
Later is not guaranteed. Life is not meant to be lived later.
