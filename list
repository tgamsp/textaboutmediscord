Oh, I'm a human, and my breathing tube is next to my eating tube. Oh, and look, my arms end in stupid little sticks.
- the good place
This guy says 'hello', I wanna kill myself.
- friends
Well, nobody's perfect.
- some like it hot
What about your children? Who knows if they're even mine? Trust me, those inbreds are definitely yours.
- the royals
Oh my God. All this time I've been hating her, have I actually been in love with her?
I'm in a relationship with myself, and I am a lot of work.
- on my block
How many days do we really remember anyway? Most days pass by unnoticed, unremarkable, unmarked.
We only remember the days we feel something happened. Something beautiful or tragic.
Step up when it's time to step up.
Mistakes I can handle, but regrets I can't live with.
I love the way your brain works.
I didn't know how much I could actually love until I met you and it keeps growing every single day.
You make me feel like I can do anything. We can do anything and I wanna do it all.
Now or never.
No early goodbyes.
Because of you, I have found someone in me that I never would have known, someone that I never would have become. You found me.
Every morning I wake up and I choose you. I choose us, I choose this.
If you're not happy, change.
Later is not guaranteed. Life is not meant to be lived later.
- all my life
I was trying to take a step forward, but I took two steps backward instead- Now take one step sideways and we can stop doing this silly little dance. Ok?
All you do is take and I've got nothing for you right now.
- uptown girls
We can try again, and maybe you won't leave. Maybe you'll find love, maybe it ain't me.
We can leave this earth, if you need space. We can get lost in the milky-way.
There ain't much that I wouldn't do to have one more day with you.
- my time machine
Just two pills and you'll feel like everyone else.
Rattle me now. You can try to change me. The last thing that you need is to be is yourself.
Push me around. Quiet and sedate me. I'm too high to know why I'm feeling like this.
Threaten me now. Tell me that I'm crazy. Addictions and fake friends are making me sick.
- die a little
Some days it's hard to breathe. Some days I'm over being me.
Some days I try my best to seem happy. Some days this place seems better off without me.
Maybe I won't feel this way some day.
Some days I feel like everyone hates me. Some days I question, "Why would God create me?"
Some days I'm holding strong. Some days I'm barely hanging on.
- some days
Nobody's ever worth my time, but maybe it was time for a change.
I don't wanna be always stuck in between. I'm in love, I'm in lust. I'm obsessed with a dream.
Should I leave before the morning? Stay until the dawn?
Am I taking you home? Are you taking me home?
Should I leave you alone? Should I just leave?
I feel you in my headspace. I'll never get you out of my mind.
Is it love or just a lovely time? Is it easier to throw it away?
- should i leave
I can fake a smile and wear it for a while if you're feeling alone.
If you need someone to be someone, well.. I can be your crutch. I care too much.
It isn't fair, I care too much.
There's not enough of me to fill the vacancy.
It's clear, I care too much. It's just pathetic to see how empathetic I've become and now I'm running out of love.
Never be a saviour, but I'm a walking favour if you're needing a hand.
I got my issues, so grab another tissue and wipe away who I am.
- i care too much
Don't listen to the voice inside your head. You're doing just fine, you're trying your best.
If no one ever told you, it's all gonna be okay.
When you lose faith in everything you ever knew don't give up on you.
You've been living off opinions for way too long. Afraid to be right, ashamed to be wrong.
Those people always keeping up to keep you down. Stop looking for a reason just to keep 'em around.
There's no one like you. One of one, never gonna find another like you.
- gonna be okay
Why aren't you into me?
You only love me when we freaking. You got me jumping off the deep end.
Only free past midnight type of shit don't sit right. Rather be alone and get high.
- the weekend
Letting everybody know, we ain't ever letting go.
All of my friends and all of my money never carried a flame to you, honey.
You got me, as long as you want me.
All of this wonder, all of this pain. There's not a moment I'd ever change.
I don't care if we get caught cause every close call makes a memory.
Hope in ten years you'll remember me.
- i got you
It's for the best, it's over now. Wasn't anyone's fault it didn't work out.
We wanted different things, we had a good run.
She's better off, and so am I. It is what it is, it's alright.
- grew apart
I hope you stay up all night all alone waiting by the phone.
- i hope
In the blink of an eye she showed me what I couldn't see.
I could get used to her eyes locked on mine. That look I can't deny as the night turns to day.
I could get used to her clothes on my floor. Never wanted anything more.
I'm gonna go with the feeling. She's my something to believe in.
- used to this
I bet you're livin' it up with every drink that you down.
Bet you're makin' gettin' over me look easy to do.
I bet you're lovin' me missin' you.
You don't want us back. Everything we did, everything we had. The way you called it quits like that. It's killing me.
- missing you
If my hand is not the one you're meant to hold. Maybe you'd be happier with someone else.
Maybe loving me's the reason you can't love yourself.
You know I'll stay, don't you tempt me, but all this weight is getting heavy.
- ghost town
Just one look into your eyes and I knew I was gonna spend my life with you.
I wanna be with you for the rest of my days.
I won't let anyone or anything come between you and me.
- forever and ever and always
When I close my eyes, I'm lying with you.
You got your head on my chest. Girl you're making me a wreck.
To tell you the truth if I tell you I'm through, I'd be lying with you.
Do you go home alone or do you end up with someone new?
- lying with you
