I get caught up in you. You're caught up in me. We're so tangled together that I just keep hurting you. You keep hurting me. We're stuck in this pattern.
Something went wrong and we tried so hard to fix it. Couldn't hold on, so we blamed it on the distance and now I'm in hell.
I hope you're happy, when I miss you madly. Don't hold it against me, but I'm not even close to letting you go yet.
I let the waves crash down. Keep it all inside. Don't try to work me out, I've done it all my life.
Just let the weight on my shoulders keep on weighing me down a little bit longer. I'm alright. Don't worry about me.
If I'm honest I need you to help me out. I need a hand sometimes
Don't let the weight on my shoulders keep on weighing me down for one minute longer. I'm so tired, so can you help me?
Mama said 'Gonna be alright.', but Mama don't know what it's like in my mind.
Mama said that 'The sun will shine.', but Mama don't know what it's like to wanna die.
I'll do anything for love. I don't feel like I'm enough. You can probably see right through me. Cause I can promise if you knew me, you would probably walk away. No, you wouldn't wanna stay.
Tell my maker, up above, that I have had enough.
Oh, please. Come bring me up from my lowest, take me higher. Can you see me through the ashes and the smoke?
What can I do when I'm not friends with my reflection and I don't understand affection like you do?
You say that you'll help me, say that I'm worth it, but I don't deserve it.
It's easy for you, you know you're perfect and I need your hand, but I don't wanna burn it.
What do I think? Why do I care? Will I leave? Am I just scared? Give me a drink, give me some air.
By the time I know just what I have, it'll be when I lose it all.
Even if we burn this down and we can't be friends, can we just be happy?
I have no right to miss you, when I didnâ€™t wanna stay. I have no right to need you, and I knew what my heart was gonna lose.
Night falls, I'm wide awake wishing I could call you. I'm too used to hearing all about your day.
Even when it's cold, you know I'll be there. No matter where we go, you know I'm right here.
Your smile is all I wanna see tonight. Being with you, it just brings me light. All I wanna do is hold you tight, if that's alright.
Even when it's rough, you know I'll be here. When times are getting tough, you know I'm right here. When life is not enough, you know I'll be there next to you.
I gave up everything to be right there. You didn't say a single word to show that you cared.
Watch my heart break to pieces, is this what you needed?
I know you don't love like I loved you and you never did all along. Tell me I'm wrong.
I gave it all just to watch you live your life. You didn't care for mine.
Who said it? You said that it's you and I forever. Who said it? You said that we'd take on the world together.
Do you want me? Do you want me like you always did? Do you want my body like when we first kissed? It's just you look at me strange, like you don't know my name.
If you won't try, then I won't try. When you say you love, I know you lie.
I wish I could read your mind, but I'm scared of what I'd find. When you tell me we're alright, is that the truth?
Did we both fall in love before we were ready? Or did we both give up before we were steady?
I guess sometimes you find the one, but the timings off. The place is wrong. Maybe we would be closer if we were a couple years older.
I guess sometimes you fall in love, but then one day it feels like you wake up and everything's over. Without any closure.
Did we both think that this was the best that we found? Or were we too afraid to have no one around?
These are questions in my head, answers I won't get. Thoughts I never said, that I kinda wish I did.
You don't have to be a hero to save the world.
It doesn't make you a narcissist to love yourself.
It feels like nothing is easy, it'll never be.
That's alright. Let it out. Talk to me.
You don't have to be a prodigy to be a geek.
You don't have to know what to say, or what to think.
You don't have to be anybody you can never be.
Anxiety. Tossing, turning in your sleep. Even if you run away, you'll still see them in your dreams.
We can talk here on the floor. On the phone if you prefer. I'll be here until your okay.
I'm afraid of all I am. My mind feels like a foreign land. Sirens ringing inside my head.
I've spent all of the love I've saved, we were always a losing game.
Loving you is a losing game.
I tell myself you don't mean a thing and what we got, got no hold on me, but when you're not there I just crumble.
Only love can hurt like this, must've been a deadly kiss.
I wouldn't care if you walked away, but every time you're there I'm begging you to stay.
Stand alone, my soul is jealous. It wants love, but I reject it. Trade my joy for my protection.
Why haven't you found me, yet?
I wish you just loved me back.
Watch them laugh at all my secrets. Scream and yell, but I feel speechless. Ask for help, you call it weakness. Lied and promised me my freedom.
When my friends start asking if I miss you, what do I say?
Don't wanna hear your name tonight. Wanna be happy, not in a mood. I don't wanna think about you.
If I hear your name one more time, I think I'm gonna lose my mind. Don't know what to do cause I'm not alright, but if I don't laugh I'm gonna cry.
Have you ever been anything other than true? Have you? Never been good, but I've never been better.
I don't want to let that body go.
Be my queen, I'll be your king. We'll be rulers, I'll give you everything.
I know I won't make it on my own.
Unbelievers, get down on your knees.
In the moment, when I feel your touch everything will turn to gold.
We say we're friends, we know we're not.
I just wanna keep you to myself. It's a rush, it's a problem.
Scared to sit close to you cause I don't trust what I might do.
You stare a bit too long, my heart, it beats unsteady.
Don't wanna let you go, but you gotta know that I need you. I need you badly.
We almost kissed last night and we still might.
I don't want your love, I just want tonight, so let's stop wasting time. I don't need your name.
On the tip of my tongue, it feels so wrong, but deep in your heart, it feels so right.
Where you hiding? I just want you to come in.
My dear, just grab my hand and let me take you to my wonderland.
I guess the night's tonight. Are you gon love me hard?
Show me how you like it done.
Look me in the eyes and confess your lust.
Hold my hand, I'll make you feel like never before.
Say my name.
Now you're calling me up on the phone, so you can have a little whine and a moan. It's only because you're feeling alone.
You say that you want me back and I tell you it don't mean jack.
You play me like an instrument, but I'm addicted to it. Yea, I'm addicted to it.
How'd we let it get this far?
Now I'm doing what I wanna do. Thinking more about me, a little less of you.
If we ever lost this, I couldn't stand it. Don't you ever let me take you for granted.
You only want me, I only want you for the rest of my life.
I still think about you when I'm lonely and I hope you think about me too.
Why'd you break me? Why'd you leave me?
I'm sick of trying to get over you, like you want me to, but I'm not.
Oh no, here I go again. Letting you back under my skin. Took so long getting over you, now I'm right back where I started.
Even after all that, kinda miss what we had. I just wanna fall back, fall back into you.
We can try to keep it a secret, but I don't want to. Why would I wanna hide that I got a girl like you.
Baby, you and me. We could be the talk of this town. We could be that rumour going around. We can make my ex go crazy when she sees your car at my house.
I'd be better off just staying home, alone, with me, myself and wine.
I better get too drunk to drive, or else I'll probably turn around and change my mind.
I got so much to tell you about the day I had, but you'll never know because you never asked.
I can't keep setting myself on fire just to keep you warm. No, I can't be the lightning and the storm.
When you wanna talk, I'm always there. We always play it your way and it's never fair.
When I need your loving, it's no where to be found and when you push me out, I always come back around.
Are you the person that makes me feel certain? If that's it, then here's the truth. Fly away, fly away. I wanna be a part of your fantasy.
Take my hand, I'll be your neverland.
You're more than just some of my treasures.
You never turned your back on me baby, even when I get a little bit crazy. 
You love every last thing about me. The cover of the book and all the pages in between. My beautiful and the not so pretty. My insecure when I'm drinking whiskey. I love that you love who I am, who I was, every last thing about me.
Is this the start of the end? Cause you don't reach for my hand over coffee or turn the lights off and tell me you want me and I feel more like a friend. Either way I would do it again.
You don't call me, so let's call it what it is and the distance doesn't get to you like I wish it did.
I could throw a fit, go kicking and screaming or I can love you and let you leave with your reasons.
The time we lost, it's no ones fault.
I think I've had enough of it. Come on, be a gentleman. Old school love, yea that old school love. Stereo over your head. Roses lying on the bed. Old school love, want that old school love.
All I want is your love to be classic. Bring your heart close to mine, so I can have it.
I don't need you to call me. Faking your love with a sorry.
Don't want the run around. A little more tequila helps it all go down. The way you turned a good thing to a battleground. They say what goes comes back around.
Your hallelujah, Sunday morning. All I've ever needed, wanted. Underneath this pale moon sky, I'm gonna make you mine.
Gonna take you slow dancing by the water, I just wanna hold you tight.
I want that all in, falling. Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling no matter what if I'm gonna love somebody like that.
Kinda heart, open arms. Says forever and will never ever take it back. If I'm gonna love somebody like that.
Love don't know what distance is.
I know it's crazy, but I don't want good and I don't want good enough. I want can't sleep, can't breathe without you love.
It doesn't make sense to anybody else. Who cares if you're all I think about? I've searched the world and I know now. It ain't right if you ain't lost your mind.
I don't want easy, I want crazy. You with me baby? Let's be crazy.
We're the kinda crazy people wish they could be.
Love too big for a love song. If I tried to sum it up, I know I'd get it wrong.
Four chords, three minutes, you'd never fit in it. So I just take you line by line. I'll be writing about you for the rest of my life.
There are things that I sing that I'll never have the confidence to say. Like I'm still not convinced that I won't be too much for you one day.
When it comes to you, I'm still tryna find the words.
Promised you I'd never leave.
What's there to talk about?
Said that you just needed me. But I gotta go and now I guess you just feel like you're not enough and it's all my fault. Please don't give it up.
I've been singing songs about you. My harmony is gone without you falling in my arms.
Why is love always so hard?
I've been writing words I mean, but I lose my rhythm when you leave.
Don't ever let me go. You're the music I need most.
The truth is that I already found you.
Even when the show is done, you'll still be my everything.
I know I'm not good at telling you the way I'm feeling.
You saw me for me, made me believe in myself.
On the day that I met you, it all turned around.
Fall into me and I'll catch you darling. We'll dance in the street like nobody's watching. It's just you and me.
I'm drunk on your voice, high on the moment. I'd fall for you twice if that's what you wanted.
I'd give you my life from now til forever. I'm falling in love with you over and over again.
Until I had met you, there was no sun in my sky, no mirrors for monsters and no love in sight.
You walked down those stairs and I knew my heart wasn't mine.
On the day that I met you, my whole world came alive.
Why don't you come on over?
Stop making a fool out of me.
Someone like you and all you know and how you speak.
I hope it's gonna make you notice.
Look at the stars. Look how they shine for you and everything you do.
You know I love you so.
I swam across. I jumped across for you. Oh, what a thing to do.
I drew a line. I drew a line for you. Oh, what a thing to do.
When you touch me I can feel how much you love me and it just blows me away.
I've never been this close to anyone or anything. I can hear your thoughts, I can see your dreams.
I don't know how you do what you do. I'm so in love with you, it just keeps getting better.
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you by my side.
Every little thing that you do. Baby, I'm amazed by you.
Baby, you surround me. You touch every place in my heart.
It feels like the first time every time. I wanna spend the whole night in your eyes.
Been wondering who will be there to take my place? When I'm gone, you'll need love to light the shadows on your face.
Could you make it on your own?
If I could, then I would. I'll go wherever you will go. Way up high or down low.
Maybe, I'll found out a way to make it back someday. To watch you, to guide you through the darkest of your days.
I hope there's someone out there who can bring me back to you.
Run away with my heart. Run away with my hope. Run away with my love.
I know now, just quite how my life and love might still go on. In your heart, in your mind. I'll stay with you for all of time.
If I could turn back time, I'll go wherever you will go. If I could make you mine, I'll go wherever you will go.
It started out with a kiss. How did it end up like this?
Choking on your alibi, but it's just the price I pay.
I don't see what you can see in someone who only causes you heartache and pain.
Hey, put on a happy face, then everything's okay.
If you're sad, don't let it show.
We're tick-tock, tick-tock, ticking like a timebomb.
Say you're good, say you're fine. Tell em everything's fine.
Lost another perfect day. I know I'll never feel the same.
Where did everything go wrong? Can we put my life on pause?
Screaming, but the pain goes on and on.
I love it when you hate it. Why am I so complicated?
I'm just stuck here feeling dead.
It was a lose, lose from the start. Stitch by stitch, I'm ripped apart.
Another day, another breakdown.
Why can't shit ever just work out?
I lost the person I used to be. I'm a walking catastrophe.
Got me begging on my knees. Somebody just fucking kill me.
Master of self-sabotage.
Don't wanna live as an untold story, rather go out in a blaze of glory.
I can't hear you, I don't fear you. I'll live now cause the bad die last.
Dodging bullets with your broken past.
Wrapped in your regret. What a waste of blood and sweat.
I wanna taste love and pain, wanna feel pride and shame.
I don't wanna take my time, don't wanna waste one line.
I wanna live better days, never look back and say could have been me.
Don't wanna live as an unsung melody, I'd rather listen to the silence telling me I can't hear you, I won't fear you.
Don't wanna wanna wake up on a Monday morning. The thought of work is getting my skin crawling.
Somebody's gonna hurt your feelings. Some lovers gonna break your heart, tear it into a million pieces.
Sometimes, some things fall apart. Not every day is gonna be easy. You might collect some scars.
We will fall, we will break. Yea, we all will make mistakes. Don't be scared, it's okay cause tomorrows another day. Let the rain wash away all the problems of yesterday.
Go easy on yourself, keep trying. Keep doing the best you can cause lord knows you're bound to fly.
Bright future in your hands, nothing's gonna stop you now. Keep your head out of the clouds.
Tell your friends that I'll be lost without you.
I hate the fast that you made me love you.
How'd you make me love you?
Fuck you for making me feel like a goddamn fool.
Goodbye to the guy I knew.
You're mistaken if you think you can manipulate me one more time.
My love is your fear.
Been a hell of a ride, but I'm thinking it's time to grow.
I'm way too young to lie here forever. I'm way too old to try, so whatever.
What am I fighting for? Whose side am I on?
Say it enough and you start believing.
Every shoulder you've leaned on is the one you will turn on.
Nobody left to forgive or forget.
What am I dying for? What have we all become?
If you cross her path you just might end up dead.
Behind those angel eyes, lies a devil in surprise.
If you break her heart, you might just meet your end.
I don't belong among the angels, and baby that's just fine with me.
I promise honey, I can feel your pain.
I promise honey, I can feel your pain and maybe I enjoy it just a little bit, does that make me insane?
You'll be thinking your past it, but it gets worse.
Baby, now I'm back on my bullshit.
Now I got you wishing you were with me, but I thought you swore this was the end.
If you're sad and you know it and you don't want to show it clap your hands.
They say that if I try that I could maybe be someone, but I'm scared because I know deep down that day may never come.
If you're sad, that's okay. You can clap it all away, just clap your hands.
Shut up and be happy, it's all in your head. Grow up and be happy cause it ain't that bad.
Talking like we used to do. It was always me and you.
Do you like walking in the rain? When you think of love, do you think of pain?
You're the reason that I feel so strong. The reason that I'm hanging on.
You know you gave me all that time. Did I give you enough of mine?
Did I catch your attention? You look like you lost your breath.
I could make it nice and easy. I'ma take the lead.
Someone told me love was only in the movies. It don't exist in real life these days.
This has gotta be the night that dreams come true. Everything feels just right cause when I'm with you.
Everything that I've ever wanted, right in front of me.
I'm empty and broken. What is the point?
I'll hide away and push everyone from me and in my mind, I face resistance. Wanna be alone, but I hate the distance.
When I die, I know they won't miss me. Give it a week, and then they will forget me.
Don't wanna be alone, but I know it's for the best. My head's like my room cause that shit is a mess.
I haven't felt like myself in months, got too attached, and now I feel stupid. I need to have a talk with Cupid, snap-in half all the arrows he shooting. I feel so god damn foolish.
If I never said goodbye to you, if I never broke your heart in two, I wouldn't hate myself the way that I do.
If I never let you slip away, if I never made so many mistakes, I wouldn't have to fall asleep through the day just so I can see your face.
Would you even talk to me? I'm sure that we'll meet in this small town. Would you look away? Pretending to stare at your phone, keep on looking down.
A million things to say, but there's no words to change the past and sorry won't work, even if it's the first time I've ever said it.
I know that I did you wrong, I know you're already gone, but I'm not the same kind of person you met. I wouldn't ever have hurt you again.
The jury said she's charming, but her exes say she's wicked.
She ain't out to get you, but she's better on your side.
She don't wanna be anybody else. She's a woman in total control of herself.
It's such a wonder to be under her spell.
Baby, don't run, you're breaking my heart.
I try to forget you. Mission impossible.
I know that we can do it right, do it right. It's time for us to come alive, come alive and do everything we didn't do. You can say my love is true, but I don't know how not to love you.
I deleted your number, your address on my phone. I don't look at your pictures or anything you post. Yet somehow you still in my head. Every hour, every day.
We both need a second chance baby to finally leave this agony cause on my own I'm going crazy and you're my sanity.
Now, I'm calling your number. Please pick up the phone, so I can give you an answer and let you know just how I love you.
Staying up real late, I miss you next to me.
I'm the only one who truly knows you best, baby. Don't forget the things we did to put our minds at ease.
I don't wanna be apart, I'll be careful with your heart cause I wear mine on my sleeve.
I don't wanna be apart, so let's go back to the start. You know that's where I'm gonna be.
We were always together, I know I made you feel better. We loved without caution.
Used to love flying solo, but now I'm not sure cause now, when I'm doing my thing I know who I'm doing it for.
If I'm fighting, I'm fighting for you and if I'm calling, I'm calling for you.
Tell me that we're giving it a try or we'll never know. We don't have to move fast, we can take it slow.
Even if it ain't all it seems, I got a pocketful of dreams.
Your timing was so wrong and I just want to be found.
Nothing's gonna hurt me with my eyes shut.
I am drawing pictures, I'm evading.
You come over with your friends. I don't wanna talk to them and all I really want is to start again.
Some days I can't even dress myself. It's killing me to see you this way.
There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back. Well, tell her that I miss our little talks.
Don't listen to a word I say. The screams all sound the same.
You're gone away, I watched you disappear. All that's left is a ghost of you. Now we're torn apart, there's nothing we can do. Just let me go, we'll meet again soon. Now wait for me, please hang around. I'll see you when I fall asleep.
Feeling stupid cause I know it ain't no you and me.
These battle scars, don't look like they're fading. Don't look like they're ever going away. They ain't never gonna change.
I wish I never looked, I wish I never touched. I wish that I could stop loving you so much cause I'm the only one that's trying to keep us together when all of the signs say that I should forget her.
I wish I couldn't feel, I wish I couldn't love. I wish that I could stop cause it hurts so much and I'm the only one that's trying to keep us together when all of the signs say that I should forget her.
I wish you weren't the best, the best I ever had. I wish that the good outweighed the bad cause it'll never be over until you tell me it's over.
When the night feels like forever I'll remember what you said to me. I know you've been hurting waiting on a train that just won't come. The rain, it ain't permanent and soon, we'll be dancing in the sun and we'll sing your song together.
Your story's gonna change, just wait for better days. You've seen too much of pain now, you don't even know that your story's gonna change.
We both admit we had it good, but until then it's alienation.
If you ask me how I'm doing, I would say I'm doing just fine. I would lie and say that you're not on my mind, but I go out and I sit down at a table set for two and finally I'm forced to face the truth. No matter what I say I'm not over you.
You do it well and I thought you were innocent. Took this heart and put it through hell, but still you're magnificent.
If I had the chance to renew, you know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do. I could get back on the right track, but only if you'd be convinced.
You just broke my heart, even though you promised you'd never do that from the start, but I guess we can only make it so far.
Let me know when it's time to come back, maybe when your life is on track and you don't have to hesitate.
Luckily for you, I'm patient. I'm ok with your making me wait and as long as you're near, I'll be here.
The memories won't go away. I feel pain every time I hear your name, but I always think of you the same.
Time wasn't in our favour. This isn't goodbye, this is simply see you later.
Your smile in the back of my mind making me feel like I just wanna know you better.
All I know is we said hello and your eyes look like coming home. All I know is a simple name. Everything has changed. All I know is you held the door. You'll be mine and I'll be yours.
All I feel in my stomach is butterflies, the beautiful kind making up for lost time, taking flight, making me feel like I just wanna know you better.
Come back and tell me why I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time.
Meet me there tonight and let me know that it's not all in my mind.
I'm not ready to be just another of your mistakes.
I fell victim to the sound of your love.
You're like a song that I ain't ready to stop.
I've got nothing, but you on my mind.
This love is difficult, but it's real. Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
Darling, nobody said that it would last forever. That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there.
I never said that we would die together. That doesn't mean it was a lie.
I wished you all the love you're looking for.
Two burning hearts are dared to break.
I'll always love you, will you always love me?
I hate that all these memories are so persistent and now I know how hard it is to move on with my life when all of these daydreams come back to me at night.
I hate that it will take time to forget this and now I know it's better to love you from a distance.
I hate that I still miss you. I wish I could forget you.
When you got nobody to turn to, just hold on and I'll find you.
I'm smiling in everyone's face, I'm crying whenever they leave the room. They don't know the battle I face, they don't understand what I'm going through.
Let's pack our stuff now and run away.
Let's make our days what we want and I'll give you my last name.
All we wanted was a place to feel like home. That's why we parted from our ways to heal our souls.
Baby, don't call me your friend.
Tried to keep you close to me, but life got in between.
Once upon a different life, we rode our bikes into the sky, but now we're caught against the tide.
I tell you I want you, but you don't listen to me.
If we never try, we'll never know what we could be.
I know we said we'd give each other space. Just need to know you're alright.
Although feelings faded, we're not strangers.
Just because we're not friends, doesn't mean I don't care. Are you alright?
Don't know how to just stop. Used to love you too much. Are you alright?
I've been losing sleep wondering if you're good, so please just pick your phone up. Let me know and I'll stop.
Ain't got everything you want, but got everything you need, so take a chance on me.
I've been sitting here tryna figure out, what did I do right to be with you right now?
After all this time, I'm still into you. I should be over all the butterflies, but I'm into you.
Some things just make sense and one of those is you and I.
You gotta admit we were so dumb. Oh baby, how did we manage to mess this up?
I'm wide awake, missing your face, missing your taste, wishing you were lost with me.
Been telling myself that it's a waste of time, but maybe I'm dumb not to call cause baby living without you ain't right.
It's you who takes care of everyone else. You need to allow me to help, you are appreciated.
It's you who somehow is always the first to take care of me at my worst. You are appreciated.
I will pull you up cause without a doubt the tables turn around, you pick me off the ground.
I can hold my breath. I can bite my tongue. I can stay awake for days if that's what you want. Be your number one.
I can fake a smile. I can force a laugh. I can dance and play the part if that's what you ask. Give you all I am.
I'm only human and I bleed when I fall down.
I'm only human and I crash and I break down.
Your words in my head, knives in my heart. You build me up and then I fall apart.
I can turn it on. Be a good machine. I can hold the weight of worlds if that's what you need. Be your everything.
It's like I'm burning from inside out and I think I know who to blame.
You're like a slo-mo explosion that you can see from space. You melt the sky to the ocean and everything that's in your way.
You left me wondering if you ever cares.
I wish you stayed, but I'll be ok cause I learned from you that life's not always fair.
I don't even miss you anymore cause I've been doing fine without you in my life.
They say that cigarettes can kill, they say to stay away from pills, that too much liquor makes you ill, but no one warned me about you.
I've always followed warning signs, but there were none in front of you.
You're gonna send me to the ER with the things you do to my heart. They could give me all the stitches, but part of me is missing. It's you.
My heart breaks when you keep your distance. I get headaches, it's just one of the symptoms. I'm a rare case and nobody knows what to do cause no one can fix me, but you.
So when our eyes have seen their better days and our hearing starts to fade, put your arms round my neck and your heart on my chest, 'I love you' will still sound the same.
Bills pile up and time tests our love. We'll stay forever in love. We'll stick to our guns, our grip won't loosen up. We say forever ain't enough.
You planned this in the end and now it's over. Say what you wanna say, you lied and I got played. You threw it all away and now it's over.
We'll be together never, so baby, you can bite me.
Just face it, we didn't make it. You bit off more than you can chew, can you taste it?
Should've held on, should've treated me right.
You're the one habit I just can't kick.
She'll tear a hole in you, the one you can't repair, but I still love her. I don't really care.
It's better to feel pain, than nothing at all.
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies.
I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known. Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone.
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me.
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating.
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me. Til then, I walk alone.
I wish my heart was always on her mind cause she's on mine like all day, all the time.
If you like me, then say you like me.
You need a pick me up? I'll be there in twenty five.
Have you no idea that you're in deep? I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week.
There's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow and I play it on repeat until I fall asleep.
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new.
Crawling back to you.
It feels so good out on the road and on my own. Waking up no strings attached, no looking back.
I know the road is my home. That's what it feels like to be free.
Always hoping that things would change, but we went right back to your games.
I've never known anybody like you.
I like you, but that's not enough.
Tell me everyday I get to wake up to that smile.
Get your heart away from me, you'll put me into a trance.
I don't want this to hurt, just don't say love. I've heard that word misused a thousand times before.
I'm not gonna run away. I'm not the type to leave you.
I'm afraid to be lonely.
So much to say, but I don't speak.
Where were you when everything was falling apart?
In the end everyone ends up alone, but losing her. The only one who's ever known who I am, who I'm not and who I wanna be.
You could give me chills on a summer day. When we're laying still, but you make my heart race.
I know that time moves on, but some things don't change.
I won't stop getting butterflies. I get them everytime I look into your eyes.
You won't stop running through my mind for the rest of both our lives.
I still fall in love with you everytime I see your eyes, it takes me back to the first time I saw you smile.
I've seen that dress on you before, but every time I do, I swear it only makes me love you more.
You know I'd fall apart without you. I don't know how you do what you do.
You're more than everything I need. You're all I ever wanted.
If I said I'm falling, would you just reply 'I know you are, but what am I?'
Was this all a joke to you?
I don't wanna say I miss you if I don't know that you miss me back.
I wish I told you that I loved you.
Some things we don't talk about, rather do without and just hold the smile.
Am I crazy to think that I could be in love? When it all ends up wasted.
I'd give you my heart, but I'd just fuck it up.
I know how to leave, but not to stay.
Swear the only one I want is you and it doesn't matter what we do.
We could have nothing at all and it'd still feel like nothing's missing.
I'm forever yours.
I thought relationships were nothing but a waste of time.  I was happy saying I had a love that wouldn't last. That was the only way I knew til I met you.
Tell me, is it only me? Do you feel the same? You know me well enough to know that I'm not playing games.
Put it down on me, take it out on me.
Text me, booty call, call me.
I'll be your favourite scene.
She'd take the world off my shoulders if it was ever hard to move.
She'd turn the rain to a rainbow when I was living in blue.
Why then if she's so perfect, do I still wish that it was you? Perfect don't mean that it's working, so what can I do?
I try to fall for her touch, but I'm thinking of the way it was.
I'm only here passing time in her arms.
Say I'm not your type, but I know what's on your mind.
Don't be shy, you decide. Say, can I make you mine?
I'm confident when I'm with you.
Even when we fade eventually, I'm nothing. You will always be my favourite form of loving.
Lately I've been feeling not alive, but you bring me back to life.
Can you be my lover up until the very end?
I'll be there, whenever you want me.
It's only you, nobody new, I put you first.
I can fill those places in your heart no one else can
Every time it feels brand new, wish I could rewind the things we do.
Everything's frozen, nothing but you and I.
Make me a promise, tell me you'll stay with me.
Let's just fall in love for the hell of it. Maybe, we'll just keep falling.
When I'm around you, I feel it in my veins. There's something about you that's making me go insane.
All of these years, all of this time, still you got all my attention.
Darling, I love that I know you like no one does.
I see all of your sides and the new ones I'm trying to learn.
I need to know, how do you feel?
Do you know how in love with you I am?
Everything that you do, it makes my heart stop.
Lay down a list of what is wrong. The things you've told them all along, pray to god they hear you.
I wrote you a letter and I threw it away. No matter how small I write it, there's always so much more to say.
I'll love you more as the years pass us by. If you ever doubt it, just look in my eyes and you'll know for sure.
Nobody said it was easy, no one ever said it would be this hard.
I wouldn't want to spend a minute loving anybody else.
I love being around you. You make it easy.
I hope he treats you better than I ever could cause you deserve the world times two.
You know that I want to be with you all the time.
I miss you so we'll take it slow.
We'll draw the curtains and never leave home.
Why do I get so nervous when I look into your eyes? Butterflies can't stop me falling for you.
If you wanna be with me, baby, there's a price to pay.
I can make your wish come true.
Waiting for someone who needs me.
You don't have to look like a movie star. I think you're good just the way you are.
Tell me if you could, would you up and run away with me?
If I showed up with a plane ticket and a shiny diamond ring with your name on it, would you wanna run away too? Cause all I really want is you.
Don't you be alone, you can always find me.
Talking to a stranger is nothing new. She knows how to smile, but not like you.
Holding onto us for worse or better.
Life is great without a car.
I ain't trying to do what everybody else doing, just cause everybody doing what they all do.
Am I wrong for thinking that we could be something for real?
Only those I really love will ever really know me.
These are questions in my head, answers I won't get. Thoughts I never said that I kinda wish I did.
I guess sometimes you fall in love, then one day feels like you wake up and everything's over.
Did we both think that this was the best that we found or were we too afraid to have no one around?
I don't think you realize how long I had to fight to be living my life, to get better and never have to try not to think of you until you reached out.
You're a real life fantasy, but you're moving so carefully, let's start living dangerously.
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy.
If you love me, don't let go.
I need you now, but I don't know you yet.
I only got half a heart to give to you and I hope it's enough.
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of, you wouldn't get this from any other guy.
I'll find the time, we will find the timing cause you are on my mind. I hope that you don't mind it.
Some say you will love me one day and I will wait, I will wait to get your loving one day.
I wanna call you up, but maybe it will only make it worse.
I want that can't sleep love. The kind that I dream about all day, the kind that keeps me up all night.
I'm tired of dreaming of no one, I need somebody next to mine.
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go.
Write this down, take my words and read them everyday. Keep them close by, don't you let them fade away, so you'll remember what I forgot to say.
I don't care what they say other lovers do, I just wanna dance with you.
I wanna dance with you, hold you in my arms once more. That's what they invented dancing for.
I'm not yours and baby you're not mine. We've got something and it sure is fine.
There's one thing that we both agree, I like you and baby you like me.
Fuck depression, I'm just under pressure.
She a sidekick, I don't need no side bitch.
Your love is scaring me, no one has ever cares for me as much as you do.
You look better every day, I swear. Really, it's a little unfair. Baby, I'm star struck by you. Didn't know we'd get so far and it's only the start.
If we fall apart, maybe it wasn't meant to be.
Would you love her the way that she loved you?
Oh my god, I'm a fool. Keep on coming back to you.
